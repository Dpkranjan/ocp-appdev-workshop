= Using Web Console

== Adding a Database
Most useful applications are "stateful" or "dynamic" in some way, and this is usually achieved with a database or other data storage. 

By default, this will use EmptyDir for data storage, which means if the Pod disappears the data does as well. In a real application you would use OpenShiftâ€™s persistent storage mechanism to attach real-world storage (NFS, Gluster, EBS, etc) to the Pods to give them a persistent place to store their data.

For Example if we want to deploy MySQL, we can search for it in catalog like below:
image:mysql-catalog.png[]

Then we can use MySQL Ephemeral for testing:
image:mysql-deploy.png[]

Then we can check the pod is created:
image:mysql-pod.png[]

== Checking Pod Information

To check Database log we can use the web console like below:
image:mysql-info.png[]

After that we can check the log:
image:mysql-log.png[]
